# PLAYING-WITH-PHP
These are some very basic php scripts that i've created when i started learning with php.
All you gotta do is place all the files that are in this branch and place them in a folder (say rajatsignup) and place that folder into your www directory.
Now just switch on your wamp server and click on the the rajatsignup folder and you're goodto go :).
